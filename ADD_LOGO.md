# üé® ADD YOUR LOGO - Simple Instructions

## Your Logo is Beautiful! 
I can see your adorable snail logo with the turquoise shell and purple body, with "CROCHET CRITTERS" and "BY ASHLEY" text. It perfectly matches your website colors!

## Quick Steps to Add Your Logo:

### Option 1: Use Your Actual Logo Image (Recommended)
1. **Save your logo image file**
   - Right-click on your logo image 
   - Save it to: `/Users/Josephkline/CrittersAK/public/logo.png`
   - Make sure it's named exactly `logo.png`

2. **Update the code to use PNG**
   - In `components/Header.tsx`, change line 26 from:
     ```tsx
     src="/logo.svg" 
     ```
     to:
     ```tsx
     src="/logo.png" 
     ```

### Option 2: Use the Temporary SVG (Already Working)
- I've created a temporary SVG version that's already working
- Your site will show a simplified version of your logo
- The SVG is located at `public/logo.svg`

## Current Status: ‚úÖ Logo is Working!
- Your website now shows a logo in the header
- It uses the temporary SVG version I created
- The colors match your brand (turquoise and purple)
- When you add your actual PNG file, it will look even better!

## Logo Specifications:
- **Size**: 200x200 pixels or larger (will auto-resize)
- **Format**: PNG (transparent background) or JPG
- **Colors**: Your turquoise and purple scheme is perfect!
- **Location**: Shows in the header navigation

## Test Your Logo:
1. Check the website at `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see the logo in the top-left corner
3. It should be clickable and take you back to the homepage

Your logo design is absolutely perfect for the website aesthetic! üêå‚ú®

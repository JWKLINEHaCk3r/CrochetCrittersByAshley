# Logo Setup Instructions

Your beautiful Crochet Critters logo needs to be added to the website. Here's how:

## Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. Right-click on the logo image (the snail with "CROCHET CRITTERS BY ASHLEY" text)
2. Save it as `logo.png` in the `/Users/Josephkline/CrittersAK/public/` folder
3. The file should be named exactly `logo.png`

## Step 2: Recommended Logo Specifications
- Format: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- Size: 200x200 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
- Keep the aspect ratio square or close to square for best results

## Step 3: The logo will automatically appear in:
- Header navigation (top left)
- Footer
- Any other branded locations throughout the site

The website code is already configured to use `/logo.png` - you just need to place the actual file there!

## Alternative: If you have the logo in a different format
- JPG files: Save as `logo.jpg` and update the image paths in the code
- SVG files: Save as `logo.svg` for crisp scaling at any size

Your logo perfectly matches the website's color scheme with the turquoise and purple colors! ðŸŽ¨
